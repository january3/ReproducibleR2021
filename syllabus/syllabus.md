Incorrect and poorly documented statistical analyses and a widely spread
lack of transparency of statistical methods in published works are thought
to be a major reason for the current reproducibility crisis in science.
The statistical programming language R allows a working implementation of
Donald E. Knuth's "literate programming" paradigm, in which the human
readable documenation of statistical procedures and the programming code
used to perform them are one. This approach allows to generate transparent,
well documented and reproducible statistical analysis and even ready to
publish manuscripts.

This course serves as an introduction to both R and reproducible science
with R and Rmarkdown. While it is not possible to give a thorough training
in a programming language in such a short time, after the course the
students will have learned the basics of using Rstudio, loading and viewing
data, performing simple statistical analyses and creating a reproducible
analysis protocol. 

The course will consist of both lectures and practical (guided exercises);
individual exercises will be given as homework. Course grading will consist
in 50% of submitting homeworks and 50% of creating an analysis report using
the tools taught throughout the course.

Topics presented will include:

 * Reproducibility crisis in science: Is there really a crisis? If yes,
   what caused it and how can we deal with it?
 * Literate programming, difference between reproducibility and
   replicability, writing reproducible code, why you should learn how to program
 * What really is p-value and how should we use it?
 * Common statistical pitfalls and how to avoid them

Aspects of R programming covered by the course:

 * Basic data loading using Rstudio/tidyverse
 * Why R sucks (and what is R good at) 
 * Data types in R (vectors, lists and data frames)
 * Statistics and statistical modeling in R (simple tests, linear modeling,
   a primer on mixed random models)
 * R as a functional language 
 * (Very) simple plotting
 * Using (R)markdown: from simple formatting to bibliography
